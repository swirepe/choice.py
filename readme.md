# choice.py

## What is it?

A small program for making choices.  Less intense than [Tireless](https://github.com/swirepe/Tireless), but similar idea.

## Why is it?

I got tired of opening up `ipython`, typing `from random import choice`, and then formatting my options in a list within a function call.  I've saved literally dozens of milliseconds of my life.

## How do I use it?
